# ConvexHull
Code of OuelletConvexHull and its workbench for CodeProject article : Fast and improved 2D Convex Hull algorithm and its implementation in O(n log h). Link: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1210225/Fast-and-improved-D-Convex-Hull-algorithm-and-its

It contains:
 - Many ConvexHull algorithm implementations
 - A workbench to test implementations working
 - A workbench to test and compare implementations performance

2018-02-06, Update: The code should be close to the one that will be available in the next article about Online Convex Hull (dynamic add).
The article should be available in a month or so.
